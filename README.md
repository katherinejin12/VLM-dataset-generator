# isaacsim-dataset-generator
This repository provides tools to generate **diverse synthetic datasets** using **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**.  

The datasets include:  
- Multiple **environments** (e.g., warehouses, outdoor scenes)  
- Various **objects and agents** (robots, humans, forklifts, drones, etc.)  
- A wide range of **trajectories and behaviors**  

The generated data is intended for **machine learning research in robotics**, supporting the training and evaluation of AI-based robotic agents under varied and realistic conditions.
